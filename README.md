# hello-world
the quintessential beginning

I have red hair, and I live in NYC.
I want to improve current coding skills and learn how to automate more tasks.
Why? So I can spend time doing more interesting things, like investigating interesting questions.
I like economics, yoga, reading, art, and math.
